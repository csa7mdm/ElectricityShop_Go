## Architecture Decisions Log

### JWT Implementation (2025-05-30)
- **Decision**: Use HMAC-SHA256 for JWT signing
- **Rationale**: Simpler key management, sufficient security for current needs
- **Impact**: Easier deployment, single secret key management

### Role-Based Access Control (2025-05-30)
- **Decision**: Implement simple role-based system (customer, admin)
- **Rationale**: Sufficient for e-commerce needs, can be extended later
- **Impact**: Clean separation of user and admin functionality

### Route Protection Strategy (2025-05-30)
- **Decision**: Separate public and protected route groups
- **Rationale**: Clear security boundaries, easier to manage
- **Impact**: Better security, clearer API structure
